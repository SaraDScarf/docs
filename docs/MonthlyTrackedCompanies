A Monthly Tracked Company (MTC) is the name of a company interacting with your open source project as surfaced by Scarf. When you add Scarf pixels to your pages or put a download behind the Scarf Gateway, Scarfâ€™s IP enrichment will reveal the names of those companies. 

It'ss first in, first out. 

For example, if you have a 100 MTC limit, you will see the first 100 companies that interact with your open source project in that given month. This could be the same as last month, if the same companies come back, or, if other companies show up first, it could be a new list. Another thing to consider is that you could hit that MTC limit on the first day of the month depending on traffic, in which case you will not see any new company information until your reset for the next month.

Scarf will always show you how many companies there are at the bottom of the Company Insights page. In the example above, you purchased 100 MTCs. You will see that Scarf is showing you 100/100 (your contract amount) out of (some larger number) of potential companies you could see. 

You can always increase the number of MTCs to see more. Contact sales to reveal more.
